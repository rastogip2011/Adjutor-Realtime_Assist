# Adjutor-Realtime_Assist

The aim of this project is to help the people residing in the Natural Disaster hit area by providing them relevant information associated with the Geographical Entities, Organizational Entities and Helping Entities in the area. The information will help help not only the people residing in the area but also will be usefull for the people who want to monitor the situation or can be used by the common public to get in touch with the real-time scenerio of the Natural Disaster hit area.

The project mainly has two parts:

1. Sharing of Geographical and Organizational details:
	In this part, all the real-time information gathering will be done automatically by the system and will be shared through an app. The information will include the current geographical details of the Disaster and its scale. Realtime Imagery form the satellites will also be provided. Hence, it will provide a real time analysis of the situation and will help the residents to know the specific and precise details of the situation and help them decide on where to move in terms of emergency. The system will also give information about the Government help centres, medical camps, subsidised food shops etc.

2. Sentiment analysis:
	An important source of information presently is social media, which reports any major event including natural disasters. Social media also includes conversational data. As a result, the volume of data on social media has an enormous increase. During the time of natural disaster like floods, tsunami, earthquake, landslide, etc., people require information in those situations, so that relief operations like help, medical facilities can save many lives.
